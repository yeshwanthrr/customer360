#  Customer 360 Powered by MapR&trade;

The <a href="https://mapr.com/products/mapr-converged-data-platform/">MapR Converged Data Platform</a> is uniquely suited to run Customer 360 applications because of its ability to host data lakes containing structured and unstructured data, integrate data sets, and run operational and analytical workloads simultaneously. MapR enables applications to glean customer intelligence through machine learning that relates to customer personality, sentiment, propensity to buy, and likelihood to churn. Check out the <a href="https://mapr.com/solutions/quickstart/customer-360-knowing-your-customer-is-step-one/">Customer 360 Quick Start Solution</a> to learn more about MapR's products and solutions for Customer 360 applications.

This demo application focuses on showing how the following three tenants to customer 360 applications can be achieved on MapR:

1. Big Data storage of structured and semi-structured data in files, tables, and streams
2. SQL-based data integration of disperate datasets
3. Predictive analytics through machine learning insights

## Overview

There are a lot of different ways to demo MapR. Some people like to use data visualizations to convey the value of MapR's technology. Other people like go deep into APIs for more developer oriented conversations. In this demo, we try to accomodate both approaches. For the graphical approach, this demo application runs in a stand-alone web server that shows interactive data visualizations (shown below). For the deep technical dive, we provide Jupyter Notebooks to show code and MapR's APIs.

# Demo Script

## Setting the Scene

You're a customer support representative. You're about to answer a call from Erika Gallardo. Before you talk to her try to answer these questions: 

- What do you think she'll be asking about?
- Is she already navigating the web site? 
- What should you keep in mind to upsell? 

## How does "convergence" make Customer Intelligence better?

Company's have all kinds of information about their customers. That information is stored in many different formats and in many different ways. It may be schemaless or schemaful. It may be in database tables, it may be in files, or it may be in social media. And it might be massive or unbounded in a never-ending stream. In all these cases, MapR provides the platform you need to store data in files, tables, and streams. **Cloud Scale data storage** is the first thing you need for a Customer 360. 

But we don't want to just store data, we want to be able to access all this information in order to understand what our customers are all about. So **Data Integration** is also a critical part for Customer 360. MapR does data integration with Apache Drill - the industry's best SQL engine for Hadoop.

But its not enough to simply consolidate datasets. We want to do more than just SQL. We want to harness the power of **Machine Learning** to not only better understand customer characteristics like sentiment, propensity to buy, and likelihood to churn but also to improve fraud detection and targeted marketing.

Cloud Scale Storage, Data Integration, and Machine Learning are essential to achieving the most value out of a Customer 360 application.  Any one of those would be a challenge by itself, but with the MapR Converged Data Platform you get them all in a package that is faster/better/cheaper than anything else.

## What's happening behind the scenes?

- **Customer Directory** is populated by a SQL query which accesses data in MapR-DB, MySQL, and JSON files. Thanks to Apache Drill, these SQL queries can be executed without specifying a schema.
- **Machine Learning** is used to predict spend rate and lifetime value by linear regressions. It's also used to create the Heatmap that identifies upsell/cross-sell opportunities for customer groups segemented by K-Means.
- **Real-Time Streaming** is used to show clickstreams for each user. This data helps customer service reps know how customers are using the Banking web site during support calls. Clickstream data is also useful for tracking customer journey.
- **Survey Feedback** is derived from surveys in which only a fraction of customers responded, but which we can extrapolate to identify patterns with other customer groups.
- **Head Shot** is an example of binary data saved as jpg files which can be used for fraud detection by smart cameras in banks.
